        <p class="about-intro-lead">IU-Luddy Autonomous Racing comprises a diverse group of passionate students from Indiana University, spanning PhD, Master's, and undergraduate programs. With expertise and interest in various facets of the autonomy stack—ranging from perception to planning to control—we are dedicated to developing and implementing cutting-edge technology for the fastest fully autonomous racing car.</p>
        <p>Our journey began in August 2023 with just 8 PhD students. Led by Prof. Lantao Liu, head of the VAIL Lab, the team quickly expanded to a cohesive team of 28 members, each specializing in different aspects of the autonomy stack.</p>
